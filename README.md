# About

This project demonstrates a server / client project written in JavaScript.  

Server side uses node.js to retrieve data from the football-api.  
Client side uses React.js to retrieve the data from server and display the data.

## Getting Started

### football-api api key
This project requires an api key from football-api.  Go to https://www.api-football.com/ for a free api key, or I can provide my api key :).

Once you have an api key, create a .env file in the root folder with the following:
```REACT_APP_SPORTS_API_KEY={your_api_key}```

To get started on react.js and node.js, see this link: https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html

## Starting the Project

Run "npm start" in the root folder to start the server.

Run "npm start" in the client folder to start the react app.
